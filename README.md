# EVA-3.0-rc1_missing_hotends
Adding support for the hotends that Rat Rig refuses to do so officially. All files released into the Public Domain, not guarantees are provided, print and use them at your own risk.

### UPDATES:
May 10th, 2022: Initial release. Hotends supported: Trianglelab/Phaetus Dragon; E3D Revo Voron.

May 10th, 2022 (LATER: it's 10:09pm BRT, or UTC-3, as I write): Uploaded Revision 2, made with better CAD models. I wasn't aware that the EVA CAD files were available through OnShape, the previous revision was made through a conversion from STL to STEP using FreeCAD. Much easier to modify now. ðŸ™‚
